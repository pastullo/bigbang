<p class="lead">Welcome to the BigBang app - the most banging app you’ll ever come across. </p>


<p class="lead">Now that you’re signed up, here’s why you’ll want to stay. No prospective bang will ever know you’ve sent them a bang request unless the vibe is mutual.</p>


<p class="lead">To join in on all the action, you’ll need to opt in. <%= User.where(:optin => true).count %> of your mates have already opted in – don’t leave them hanging.</p>



<%= button_to 'Yes, I want to optin!', change_optin_user_path(current_user, :optin => true), class: 'btn btn-success' %>
<%# button_to 'Opt Out', change_optin_path(:optin => false) %>
